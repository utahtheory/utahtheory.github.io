## README (elfriedman.github.io)

Personal website, modeled after [Jonathan Conroy](https://jonathan-conroy.github.io/)'s website, which was created with help from [Michael Ngai](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-ngai-888a13270/).
The layout is inspired by the [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) theme.

**To run locally:** Install/update node.js (eg., `brew upgrade node`) and then run `npx http-server`.
